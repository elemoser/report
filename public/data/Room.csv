Beyond the garden, in the distance, lies a neighboring farm, its red-roofed barn standing proudly against the backdrop of rolling hills. From the corner of the kitchen window, you catch a glimpse of the neighbor harvesting corn from the fields in his red tractor.
On the east side of the kitchen, a weathered door adorned with a brass knob beckons you to explore the treasures within."

Juicy strawberries peek from beneath lush green leaves, while the graceful leaves of mangold sway in the breeze. In the back gardenbeds young carrots proudly emerge from the earth next to sun-ripened tomatoes blushing with color."

Adorned with a simple yet inviting ""Self-Service"" sign, it serves as a delightful treasure trove of farm-fresh goods. Inside, the aroma of earth's bounty fills the air, as baskets brimming with golden corn, freshly dug potatoes, and jars of golden honey line the shelves.
A small fridge with a glass door offers a glimpse into dairy delights. Within, creamy milk, velvety heavy cream, and glistening eggs await those seeking the essence of farm-fresh goodness. Blocks of rich, golden butter stand alongside, promising to elevate every culinary creation with their smooth and indulgent flavors.
Visitors can partake in the self-service experience, selecting their preferred produce and dairy essentials, knowing they are supporting the local farm. Adjacent to the fridge, a small box with a slit on the top side hangs from the wall, providing a trustworthy means for visitors to place their payment as they purchase the farm's delectable products."
